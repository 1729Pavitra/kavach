Hello All :)

So here it is, the first release of the the-sh shell ! As of now, this is a pretty ordinary shell with no support for subroutine calls
The loops and conditional statements can have a depth of atmost 1 

FEATURES: 

1) internal commands :
		
		exit : does what it is supposed to do :P
		cd : do i need to tell what this does??
		export : export in jash can only export strings, (not integers). (jash supports 2 types of variables: strings and integers)
			syntax: export var
			
		print : prints value of jash on stdout
			syntax: print var
		
2) variables :
		
		syntax: 
		var = "string"
		var1 = ( 8 + ( var2 * 9 ) ) 
		.......and the like
		(NOTE: string concatenation is not supported as of now)
		
		
//support for integers in this version would not really be effective because of absense of loops and all...but nevertheless, it there :)
