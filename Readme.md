# Kavach

**kavach** is a minimal shell written out of pure curiousity, in order to understand how shells work internally. The goal is not to write a complete shell; but to write an educational shell.

Hopefully, **kavach** would serve as a tutorial for someone who wants to understand how shells work.

## Installation

The source is available at [http://github.com/anayjoshi/kavach](http://github.com/anayjoshi/kavach)

To run the shell without installing it on your system:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/anayjoshi/kavach
$ cd kavach
$ make
$ ./kavach
```

To install **kavach**, execute

$ sudo make install
```

You can also uninstall **kavach**:
