# The-sh

**the-sh** is a minimal shell written out of pure curiousity, in order to understand how shells work internally. The goal is not to write a complete shell; but to write an educational shell.

Hopefully, **the-sh** would serve as a tutorial for someone who wants to understand how shells work.

## Installation

The source is available at [http://github.com/anayjoshi/the-sh](http://github.com/anayjoshi/the-sh)

To run the shell without installing it on your system:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/anayjoshi/the-sh
$ cd the-sh
$ make
$ ./the-sh
```

To install **the-sh**, execute

```
$ sudo make install
```

You can also uninstall **the-sh**:

```
