the-sh
######

the-sh is a minimal shell written out of curiousity, in order to understand how shells work. The goal is not to write a complete shell; but to write a shell with which you can spend an ordinary day without getting frustrated. The only features which I intend to add are

- tab completition
- command history (arrow keys and reverse search)
- neat, colored prompt
- pipes, IO redirection

(these are almost all the features that I usually use)


Hopefully, this would serve a dual purpose: 
- act as a tutorial for students who want to understand how a shell works
- a shell I would be using on a regular basis

Features: 
--------

* internal commands :
		
-		exit : does what it is supposed to do!
-		cd : do i need to tell what this does??
-		export : add a variable in the exvironment variable list
-		print : prints value of a variable on stdout
		
* variables :
		
		syntax: 
		var = "string"
